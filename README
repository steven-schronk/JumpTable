This is a Jump Table program written for the bash shell.

It allows a user to quickly change from one directory to another
as well as a quick reference to commonly used directories on the system.

The program stores the configuration in a file named ".jump_table"
located by default in your home directory.

Installation is simple: add contents of j.bash file to your .bash_profile.
When you log into the system again (or restart bash) the function will be
available for use.

This program has been verified to work in bash version 3.X.X and several
Linux distributions including Red Hat, OpenSuSE and Slackware.

The program requires several common commands to operate:

cat
cp
grep
pwd
sed

I have kept its functionality as simple as possible. One possible
improvement could include the ability to create several jump table files
for use in different types of tasks.
